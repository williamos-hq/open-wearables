"""Deprecated webhook routes retained for backward compatibility.

These paths were registered in production before the unified
``/providers/{provider}/webhooks`` architecture was introduced.

New integrations must use:
  POST /api/v1/providers/{provider}/webhooks

Migration status:
  Garmin  — was in production; old URLs kept until Garmin Developer Portal
            is updated to the new canonical path.
  Oura    — was not in production; old paths kept for completeness only.
  Strava  — was not in production; old paths kept for completeness only.
