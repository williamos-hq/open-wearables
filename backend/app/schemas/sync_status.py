"""Schemas for sync status events streamed via SSE.

A sync status event represents a state transition during a data
synchronization run for a user. Events are produced by Celery tasks
(pull syncs, Garmin backfill, SDK uploads) and webhook handlers, and
distributed to clients via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
